current minigoal -- create a basic mod that

* loads a plugin that prints "hello world" on startup
* allows you to adjust video settings etc
* lets you load any storymode map

next minigoal -- load a workshop map

current list of challenges / thoughts / questions / comments --

* development is always on linux, how can i build a plugin though?
* vpkedit to edit the menu screen
* how is plugin loading linked into loading the mod? is it just hardcoded in srconfigs somewhere?
* what do i need to compile a barebones plugin from scratch? shouldn't i need source sdk 2013 or something? how can i just seemingly compile the entire p2sm and just get it running? is it loading the shared files from the base game directly? is this portable / future proof?
* can i version lock my game somehow to prevent the update fucking things up for me?
